{"name":"Canvas by Cambridge Design Partnership","body":"### Welcome to the Canvas pages\r\nSocial multimedia such as artwork, news stories, YouTube videos and holiday snaps etc. are a great way to improve office culture and interaction promoting a good creative atmosphere. However many businesses see it as a distraction and  drain on resource, and some even choose to block social media sites behind a firewall.\r\n\r\nOur innovative solution is to embrace the creative environment which social media promotes and encourage staff to add content to a common digital ‘Canvas’ located in a communal area such as the staff kitchen or breakout areas.\r\n\r\nBy allowing the ‘community’ to generate and organise content, Canvas is self regulating and once set-up requires minimal maintenance. In trials, staff adopted the idea quickly, posting interesting content and enjoying the media together in a social hub.  This resulted in a dramatic reduction in the level of email spam and increased the sharing of stimulating media and inspiring ideas.\r\n\r\nUsers can interact directly with the large communal multi-touch display to move, resize, rotate and play content, or they can add content by accessing the service on their desktop browsers which are automatically synchronised.\r\n\r\nContent posted to date has included photographs of world travel, impressive human feats, sharing of project related successes and the best YouTube has to offer!  In trials we have also seen Canvas being used as an innovation tool, with staff adding interesting new technology and designs, which encourages co-creation and innovation on projects.\r\n\r\nWe think this is a great tool for any business and have therefore provided a free download on our website www.cambridge-design.co.uk so you can try Canvas in your own environment.  We have developed this tool as an ‘Open Source’ project allowing the wider community to improve and enhance its functionality and allowing greater integration with other technology.\r\n\r\n### Try it for yourself\r\n\r\nTo test Canvas in your own office you will need a Windows PC, preferably with a touchscreen display.  We use the Lenovo IdeaCentre range of all-in-one PCs for simple wall-mountable installation, however any Windows PC should work.\r\n\r\nFirstly download the latest USB image [from here] (https://github.com/bencrundwell/canvas/downloads) and extract it onto a USB memory stick.\r\n\r\nThen insert the USB stick into the PC you want to use canvas on and run 'Canvas Server'  this should boot up the servers automatically and then open canvas in the included Firefox browser.  Simple!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCanvas was created by Ben Crundwell (@bencrundwell) as an internal project for Cambridge Design Partnership in 2012.  \r\nYouTube downloading support has been provided by Ricardo Garcia's (@rg3) [youtube-dl project](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl).\r\nUSB WAMP support was provided by Timo Haberkern's [Server2Go project] (http://www.server2go-web.de/).\r\nWe would also like to acknowledge PortableApps.com for creating [Firefox Portable] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableapps/) \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Canvas?
